This submission included "X.txt" and "Y.txt" contains data in text files.

There are a IPYNB File and a Python File, named Multi-class Classification. 
They both contain the same code. The code imported numpy and matplotlib.pyplot libraries.

I would recommand open the IPYNB file using Jupyter NoteBook.

The CSE353_Assignment5_Report.pdf file is my report for this assignment.
